- 👋 Hi, I’m Ethan
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Rust as a language, as well as microcontrollers in Assembly. I do not know enough about coding to fully understand what I am interested in yet. This will be updated when possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Rust and C++ (and formally studying electrical engineering)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nothing so far. (I have no idea why my profile lists 3 contributions) (ah nvm it counts the README edits)
- 📫 How to reach me ... at ethanmckiethomson@gmail.com
